Skeet Skeet is a game, 2 boys and I created during a semester for our Entertainment Software Design class at CC. This game is a rendition of an old arcade game that started with primitive shapes passing through each other while they cross the screen which evolved into the current version. The current version has four levels consisting of object flying through the sky at random group densities and trajectories.
